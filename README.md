# News Website

## Overview
A simple news app that pulls articles by category (tech, business, general). I originally made it with React + Vite but switched to Next.js so I could use serverless stuff and keep things cleaner.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Firebase Firestore
- GNews API
- Finnhub WebSocket API
- CSS (basic styling)

## To-Do
- Improve overall styling and layout
- Add more stock and crypto price tracking with Finnhub
- Add error handling for failed API requests

Not super polished yet but it works. Just a project for fun and learning.
